Here's revision one of the bottom tilesheet. We're pretty happy with the tiles in it but we still might add some in the future.

Here are the guarantees you have for bottom.png:
 - The tiles will always be 40x40 pixels.
 - We will always have 8 columns.
 - We won't delete the 43 existing tiles.

The tiles are numbered as such:

 _________________
|0               8|
|9              16|
|                 |
|    and so on    |
|                 |
|                 |
|                 |
|_________________|

Note: You'll notice that tile 39 doesn't exist yet. Make sure not to use it or you'll get a blank spot in your map.
